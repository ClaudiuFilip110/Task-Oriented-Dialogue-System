# Task-Oriented-Dialogue-System (with RL and DL)

This project is my dissertation thesis. I've used [ConvLab2's toolkit](https://github.com/thu-coai/ConvLab-2) for building a chatbot. 
I wanted to experiment with Reinforcement Learning algorithms and Depp Learning models.

# Results
When training the NLU (jointBERT) and the NLG (SG-GPT) I had marginal improvements over the published results.
Unfortunately, the RL results were less than ideal, but I am still happy with the results I've gotten. ML is awesome!
